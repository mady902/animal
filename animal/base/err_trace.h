/*
 * Description:  This module implements the error trace used in animal_err.[ch].
 *
 *               An error trace is a last-in first-out (LIFO) stack for
 *               temporarily holding details of multiple error events
 *               until an application is ready to read the stack.
 *
 *               The stack is usually flushed by the function in a
 *               sequence of nested calls that initially detects an
 *               error. As the call stack unwinds the successive
 *               functions also register errors, but they should not
 *               flush the error trace.
 *
 *               The stack is implemented as a linked list of error
 *               records. If in the process of allocating heap memory
 *               for a new error record a memory error occurs, then
 *               this is refered to as a deep error.
 *
 *               The stack always maintains two preallocated and unused
 *               error records for storing the details of the deep
 *               error and the error that was in the process of being
 *               registered when the deep error occured.
 *
 *               Even if the top of the stack holds a deep error record
 *               and the two preallocated records are used, new errors
 *               can still be registered into the trace. These attempts
 *               may lead to repeated deep errors, in which case the
 *               top deep error serves as an indicator of the deep
 *               continuing error state. However, if the registration
 *               process is successful (because in the intervening
 *               time, some external agent has free'd heap memory) the
 *               old deep error record is left on the stack and the new
 *               errors are registered on top of it.
 *
 *               To ensure that the stack has at least two preallocated
 *               records at process startup time, the bottom and second
 *               to bottom records of the stack use statically
 *               allocated memory. These can never be dynamically
 *               free'd.
 *
 *               To do this, an external module must define two static
 *               error records. In animal_err.c, this is implemented as:
 *
 *               Animal_ErrorTrace record_last =  {NULL, ANIMAL_ET_YES, ANIMAL_ET_NO,
 *                                              ANIMAL_ET_YES, NULL,
 *                                              ANIMAL_EC_DFT_SPARE, NULL, 0,NULL};
 *               Animal_ErrorTrace record_2nd_last =  {&record_last, ANIMAL_ET_YES,
 *                                                  ANIMAL_ET_NO,  ANIMAL_ET_YES,
 *                                                  NULL,ANIMAL_EC_DFT_SPARE,
 *                                                  NULL,0,NULL};
 *
 *               Animal_ErrorTrace * animal_et_trace_top = &record_2nd_last;
 *
 *               The symbol animal_et_trace_top refers to the current top
 *               of stack and is passed into the functions defined in
 *               this module as argument 1.
 *
 *               NB. A statically allocated string containing the deep
 *               error text message must also exist, but this is
 *               defined in animal_err_trace.c.

/**
 * \brief Stores details of single error in an error trace.
 *
 * Error trace is a last in, first out stack of structures containing
 * details of recorded errors. The stack is implemented as a linked
 * list that is traversed by following 'prev' links.
 *
 * The bottom (oldest) and 2nd to bottom record of the error trace are
 * statically allocated, while all others are dynamically allocated
 * (malloc'd). Important that animal_et_flush doesn't try to free() the
 * statically allocated records.
 *
 * \param prev Address of previous (next oldest) record in error trace
 *             Prev for last record is NULL.
 * \param f_static_record Is this record statically or dynamically allocated
 *        If it's static, don't try and free() it. 
 * \param f_static_message Is the text message in this record is contained in a
 *        statically or dynamically allocated char array.
 *        If it's static, don't try and free() it.
 * \param f_spare Whether is record contains details for an error, or is
 *                spare.
 * \param func_name       Name of function in which error occurs
 * \param err_code        Numeric code of error. Default set is defined
 *                        in animal_exception_codes*.h 
 * \param file_name       Name of file in which error occurs 
 * \param line_number     Line in file at which error occurs
 * \param message         Message string describing error
 *
 * A record has the status "spare" and "not spare". A spare record is
 * always kept in advance so that a deep error can be registered in a
 * memory shortage situation. A record is designated spare when it
 * carries and error code of EC_DFT_SPARE.
 *
 * The text message pointed to by "message" normally resides in a
 * dynamically allocated char array, except for the deep error message
 * which resides in a static char array. Therefore if the error code
 * is EC_DFT_DEEP_ERROR, then the message char array should never be
 * subjected to \c free().
