The ANIMAL IMage Processing LibrarY

TODO
====

- add --enable-optimize-memory to configure.ac, or something like
  that. This will make memory optimization useful for big images. 
  For example, 2D indexing would be done by a calculation (RC2) 
  instead of using a lut (RC).

- DOXYGENate it 
- Color imaging
- see @@@, TODO's and XXX marks in source files
- make test (at least to test hello output)

- memory management: use xmalloc wrappers (see autotools book)
- error treatment: use something like the atotools book, remove
  the one done in "util.h"
